        Introduction</span></big><i><br>
      <br>
      RA</i> is<i> </i>a relational algebra interpreter that translates
    relational algebra queries into SQL queries, then executes the SQL
    on a standard relational database system. RA was developed by <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cs.duke.edu/%7Ejunyang/">Prof.
      Jun Yang</a> at Duke University. The version of RA we're using for
    the workbench runs on the PostgreSQL open-source relational database
    system.<br>
    <p>The simplest relational algebra expression is one that returns
      the contents of a single relation: just write "<tt><i>relName</i></tt>",

      where <tt><i>relName</i></tt> is the name of the relation.
      Relation and attribute names are case-insensitive; for example, <tt>pizzeria</tt>
      is the same as <tt>PIZZERIA</tt>. Every operator starts with a
      backslash (<tt>\</tt>). Here is an example of a complex query; it
      finds all pizzas eaten by at least one person who does not
      frequent the 'Dominos' pizzeria. </p>
    <pre>   \project_{pizza} (
      ((\project_{name} Person)          // all people
       \diff
       (\project_{name}                  // people who frequent Dominos
           \select_{pizzeria='Dominos'}
                Frequents)               // join with Eats to find pizzas
      \join Eats));
</pre>
    The syntax is insensitive to whitespace, and queries may span
    multiple lines. Make sure to end your query with a <strong>semi-colon.</strong><br/><big><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></big><br>
    <p><big><span style="font-weight: bold;">Operators</span></big><br>
    </p>
    <p>RA supports the following relational algebra operators: </p>
    <ul>
      <li><tt>\select_{<i>cond</i>}</tt> is the relational selection
        operator. For example, to select people with name Amy or Ben, we
        write "<tt>\select_{name='Amy' or name='Ben'} Person</tt>". The
        syntax for <i>cond</i> follows SQL: string literals can be
        enclosed in single or double quotes, and boolean operators <tt>and</tt>,
        <tt>or</tt>, and <tt>not</tt> may be used. Comparison operators
        <tt>&lt;=</tt>, <tt>&lt;</tt>, <tt>=</tt>, <tt>&gt;</tt>, <tt>&gt;=</tt>,
        and <tt>&lt;&gt;</tt> work on both string and numeric types.</li>
      
      <li><tt>\project_{<i>attr_list</i>}</tt> is the relational
        projection operator, where <tt><i>attr_list</i></tt> is a
        comma-separated list of attribute names. For example, to find
        the pizzas served by Applewood (but without the price
        information), we write "<tt>\project_{pizza} (\select_{pizzeria='Applewood'} Serves)</tt>". </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><tt>\cross</tt> is the relational cross-product operator. For
        example, to compute the cross-product of <tt>Person</tt> and <tt>Frequents</tt>,
        we write "<tt>Person \cross Frequents</tt>".<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><tt>\join</tt> is the relational natural join operator. For
        example, to join <tt>Person(name,age,gender)</tt> and <tt>Frequents(name,pizzeria)</tt>
        enforcing equality on the shared <tt>name</tt> attribute, we
        simply write <tt>"Person \join Frequents</tt>". Natural join
        automatically equates all pairs of identically named attributes
        from its inputs (in this case, <tt>name</tt>), and outputs only
        one attribute per matching pair. The schema of the result in our
        example is<tt>(name,age,gender,pizzeria)</tt>.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><tt>\join_{<i>cond</i>}</tt> is the relational theta-join
        operator. For example, to join the two relations <tt>Person(name,age,gender)</tt>
        and <tt>Serves(pizzeria,pizza,price)</tt>enforcing that the
        pizza price is lower than the person's age, we write "<tt>Person \join_{age&gt;price} Serves</tt>". Syntax for <i>cond</i>
        again follows SQL; see notes above for <tt>\select</tt>. </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
    <li><tt>\union</tt>, <tt>\diff</tt>, and <tt>\intersect</tt> are
        the relational union, difference, and intersection operators,
        respectively. As a trivial example, to compute the union between
        <tt>Person</tt> and itself, we write "<tt>Person \union Person;</tt>",








        which returns the original <tt>Person</tt> relation. To compute
        the difference between <tt>Person</tt> and itself, we write "<tt>Person \diff Person;</tt>", which returns the empty relation. To
        compute the intersection between <tt>Person</tt> and itself, we
        write "<tt>Person \intersect Person;</tt>", which again returns
        the original <tt>Person</tt> relation. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Warning: </span>RA allows these
        operators to be applied to any two subexpressions that produce
        an equal number of attributes, even if the corresponding
        attribute names don't match. (See also the note about attribute
        order under<span style="font-weight: bold;"> Limitations</span>
        below.) This allowance is typical of most SQL implementations
        but violates the requirements of pure relational algebra. As
        good practice, and for unambiguous attribute names in the
        result, we suggest using the <tt>\rename </tt>operator (next)
        as needed to enforce matching schemas whenever <tt>\union</tt>,
        <tt>\diff</tt>, or <tt>\intersect</tt> is used.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><tt>\rename_{<i>new_attr_name_list</i>}</tt> is the relational
        renaming operator, where <tt><i>new_attr_name_list</i></tt> is
        a comma-separated list of new names, one for each attribute of
        the input relation. For example, to rename the attributes of
        relation <tt>Person</tt> and compute the cross-product of <tt>Person</tt>
        with itself, we write "<tt>\rename_{name1,age1,gender1} Person \cross \rename_{name2,age2,gender2} Person;</tt>". Note we could equivalently write "<tt>\rename_{name1,age1,gender1,name2,age2,gender2} (Person \cross Person);</tt>".</li>
    </ul>
    <br/><big><span style="font-weight: bold;">Limitations</span></big><br>
    <br>
    Currently, RA has the following limitations:
    <ul>
      <li><tt>\rename</tt> only supports renaming of attributes; it does
        not support renaming of relations. </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>RA expressions may yield multiple attributes with the same name, but it is not possible to refer to the ambiguously-named attributes "later" in the expression. If a subexpression yields multiple attributes with the same name and you wish to refer to one or more of them, you must use the <tt>\rename</tt> operator to make them unique.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The standard </span><tt style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><i>relName</i>.<i>attrName</i></tt><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> notation for referencing an
          attribute is neither needed nor </span><span style="color:
          rgb(0, 0, 0);">supported. </span>Using the<tt> \rename</tt>
        operator<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">, attribute name
          names can always be made unambiguous.</span>
        <p></p>
      </li>
</ul><ul>
	<li><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">As in most SQL
          implementations, attribute order is relevant in relations and
          in the result of expressions. This property is significant
          primarily for set operators, which as mentioned above do not
          consider attribute names. For example, if we take the </span><tt>\union</tt><span style="font-family: monospace;"></span> of relations <tt>R(A,B)</tt>
        and <tt>S(B,A)</tt>, the result contains two columns: (1) the
        union of the <tt>A</tt> values in <tt>R</tt> and the <tt>B</tt>
        values in <tt>S</tt>; (2) the union of the <tt>B</tt> values
        in <tt>R</tt> and the <tt>A</tt> values in <tt>S</tt>. As
        mentioned above, as good practice we suggest using the <tt>\rename</tt> operator to enforce matching schemas on <tt>R</tt> and <tt>S</tt>
        before applying the <tt>\union</tt>.<br>
      </li></ul><ul>
      <li style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> Error messages in response to
        ill-formed RA expressions may not be especially meaningful.
        Recall that RA translates relational algebra expressions into
        SQL queries. Often an incorrect RA expression simply results in
        incorrect SQL queries. In these cases, RA just passes back the
        error messages from the underlying DBMS, without attempting to
        create RA-specific messages. </li>
    </ul>
